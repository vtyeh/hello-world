# hello-world

my name is venessa tai yeh. venessa as in vanessa but spelled with an e, because my dad didn't know how to spell it. tai as in taiwan, where my mom is from. yeh as in yay, i'm glad we met! i'm an explorer of human consciousness and a lover of life. i believe that science and magic aren't all that different. i love dancing and singing and feeling the ocean around my ankles.
